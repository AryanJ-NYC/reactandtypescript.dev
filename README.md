# React and TypeScript

## Description

I created [React And TypeScript](http://reactandtypescript.dev) as a way for me to learn React and TypeScript. I decided to share my notes online which is exactly what you're looking at here. I hope for this project to grow and be _THE_ default source for React and TypeScript documentation.

## Run Locally

In your terminal at the project root, run:

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`

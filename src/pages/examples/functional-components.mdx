# Functional Components
Given that functional components are just functions that take in props as a parameter, we can do the following:

```tsx
type HelloWorldProps = {
  userName: string;
};

const HelloWorld = ({ userName }: HelloWorldProps) => (
  <div>Hello, {userName}!</div>
);
```

However, this does not take the `children` prop into account. Use the `React.FC` type and define the generic as your props type.

```tsx
type HelloWorldProps = {
  userName: string;
};

const HelloWorld: React.FC<HelloWorldProps> = ({ children, userName }) => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello, {userName}</p>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

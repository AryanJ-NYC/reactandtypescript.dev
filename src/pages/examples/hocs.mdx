# Higher Order Components (HOCs)

Please note that this section uses the `utility-types` [package](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types) since, as of May 2019, the helper functions were unavailable in TypeScript.

## Injected Props

HOCs often inject props into wrapped components. In the below example, `T` is defined as the `WrappedComponent` props together with the

```typescript
import { ComponentType } from 'react';
import { Diff } from 'utility-types';

export interface WithWoofStringProps {
  woof: string;
}

export default function withWoofString<T extends WithWoofStringProps>(
  WrappedComponent: ComponentType<T>
) {
  const woof = 'woof';

  // note below that Diff removes the props from T that exist in WithWoofStringProps
  // this leaves us with the props of the originally passed in component (without the injected props)
  const hocComponent = (props: Diff<T, WithWoofStringProps>) => (
    <WrappedComponent {...(props as T)} woof={woof} />
  );
  return hocComponent;
}
```
